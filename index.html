      <h2>Author's Note</h2>
      <p>
        This document is an attempt to unify various simplified versions of the
        microformats2 representative JSON format.  As such, much of this document
        is likely to change as various implementations contribute input.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JF2 is a JSON based document format that describes single entries of
        information and lists of those entries.  The primary use case for JF2 is to
        create a JSON format for social web post objects to be processed directly by
        client software and by other servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        JF2 is vocabulary independent except for its profiles which are fully
        vocabulary aware.  Rather than defining a new vocabulary the profiles
        described in this document use the vocabulary defined by [[microformats2]]
        (MF2); however, any other suitable vocabulary could be used.  The name JF2
        comes from its origins in being a direct parsed format of microformats2 data
        from HTML.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        JF2 has evolved as a result of a variety of use-cases for different implementations
        exploring ways to simplify their existing use of canonical parsed microformats2 JSON
        output.  All of these use cases in particular are simply to have a single format for
        the storage and use of social web objects.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="#webmention.io">Webmention.io</a> is a service that provides Webmention
      processing and verification on behalf of other sites.  It uses a simple JSON object to
      transfer a processed Webmention back to the client site's JavaScript for display.  The
      attributes are intended to be processed only by the client site's JavaScript code, not
      by anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="#mf2util">mf2util</a> is a utility library that provides a layer on top
      of microformats processing.  The library returns only a simple JSON object and strips
      off any unnecessary information leaving the library user only the most essential information.
      </p>
      <p>
      Various services (<a href="#xray">XRay</a>, <a href="#unmung">Unmung</a>, <a href="#socialstreams">SocialStreams</a>)
      provide conversion from microformats pages into JF2 for quick inspection to
      validate proper semantics.

        <h3>Documents</h3>

        <p>
          Conforming documents are those that comply with all the conformance
          criteria for JF2 documents. For readability, some of these conformance
          requirements are phrased as conformance requirements on publishers.
          Such requirements are implicitly requirements on documents: by
          definition, all documents are assumed to have a publisher.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conforming documents must not use features of JSON-LD or other
          serialization features disallowed in this specification. Conforming
          documents that include types or properties beyond those defined in
          [[microformats2]] must use [[microformats2]]'s prefixing methods to indicate
          non-standard properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          A non-exhaustive list of examples of documents includes:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A document representing an author
          </li>
          <li>
            A document representing an event
          </li>
          <li>
            A document representing a post
          </li>
          <li>
            A document representing a collection of the posts created by an author
          </li>
          <li>
            A document representing a collection of people
          </li>
          <li>
            A document representing a like

        <h3>Implementations</h3>

        <p>
          Conforming implementations are software that publish, store, analyze,
          consume or otherwise process conforming documents. The two main kinds
          of implementations are publishers and consumers.
        </p>

        <section>

          <h4>Publishers</h4>

          <p>
            Conforming publishers are implementations that create and publish
            conforming documents. Conforming publishers must make conforming
            documents available according to the serialization requirements of
            this document. Conforming publishers must consider privacy as described
            in the <a href="#privacy">Privacy</a> section of this document.
            Conforming publishers must consider security as described in the
            <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section
            of this document.
          </p>

          <p>
            A non-exhaustive list of example publishers includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A social network
            </li>
            <li>
              A personal web site
            </li>
            <li>
              A document publishing system
            </li>
            <li>
              A bridge from a non-conforming social network
            </li>
            <li>
              A document converter from similar document types such as RSS, Atom,
              or JSON Feed
            </li>
          </ul>

        </section>

        <section>

          <h4>Consumers</h4>

          <p>
            Conforming consumers are implementations that read and analyze
            conforming documents. Conforming consumers must not halt on any
            unrecognized properties or types.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conforming consumers may re-publish conforming documents in other
            other data formats. Conforming consumers may present conforming
            documents to a user on screen, in print, in audio format, or using
            other presentation mechanisms. Conforming consumers must faithfully
            translate the information represented in conforming documents into
            these other formats or media. Conforming consumers that re-publish
            conforming documents must consider privacy and security as described
            in the <a href="#privacy">Privacy</a> section and 
            <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section
            of this document.
          </p>

          <p>A non-exhaustive list of example consumers includes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A social network
            </li>

    <section id='syntax'>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>
      JF2 consists of JSON objects which are defined by a <a>type</a> property that will specify
      the vocabulary of the object.  Properties are attached to these objects which will contain
      either a single string, a single object, an array of strings, or an array of objects.
      Arrays that have only a single item SHOULD be condensed into only the single containing item.
      Any property of an object MAY be a single item or an array of items except for reserved words
      defined below.
      </p>
      <section id='reservedkeywords'>
        <h3>Reserved Keywords</h3>
        <p>
          The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as property names in vocabularies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>type</dfn> defines the object classification.  In microformats, this is presumed
          to be an h-* class from the microformats2 vocabulary.
          Type MUST be a single string value only.</li>
          <li><dfn>children</dfn> is a container for all unnamed sub-objects inside
          an entry.  That is, any sub-object that is not associated to a specific property of the object.
          If a children value is set, it MUST be serialized as an array even if only a
          single item is present.</li>
          <li><dfn>references</dfn> is an associative array, serialized as a JSON object, of all sub-objects
          inside an object which have "id" defined as an external [[!URL]].
          The authoritative source for all objects in this array is always at the URL, not in this object.
          If the references property is defined, it MUST be serialized as an associative array and MUST be
          present at the top level entry only.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>content-type</dfn> is the MIME media type of the containing object.
          Content-type MUST be a single string value only.</li>
          <li><dfn>html</dfn> is the text/html version of the containing object.
          html MUST be a single string value only.</li>
          <li><dfn>text</dfn> is the text/plain version of the containing object.
          text MUST be a single string value only.</li>
          <li><dfn>lang</dfn> is the localization language of the containing object and all
            sub-objects, unless overridden by another lang definition. 
            Setting lang at a lower level overrides any lang value set at higher levels.
            This value MUST be a single string value and MUST be a [[!RFC5646]] language tag.</li>
          <li><dfn>@context</dfn> is the context of the vocabulary as defined in [[JSON-LD]].
            This attribute MAY be omitted and has an inferred value if not present.  If it is present it MUST be
            present at the top level entry only.  See the <a href="#JSON-LD">JSON-LD Consideration</a> section.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
  
      <section id='posts'>
        <h3>Posts</h3>

        <section id="post-objects">
          <h4>Post Objects</h4>
          <p>
            A post is composed of a "type" property, and one or more additional properties that describe the post.
          </p>
          <p>
          The "type" property has a value that describes the vocabulary of the post. Common values include "entry", "card", etc. See <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2#v2_vocabularies">microformats2 vocabularies</a> for the full list when using a microformats based vocabulary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any additional properties in the post object are considered part of the post's vocabulary.
          </p>

        </section>
        <section id="post-properties">
          <h4>Post Properties</h4>
          <p>
            The list of valid post properties is defined by the vocabularies. This allows new vocabularies to be developed outside the development of the syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most values will be strings. If a property (such as "author" for example) references another
            object, it may be serialized in two ways: as an inline JSON object or as the unique identifier
            or [[!URL]] where the object can be found.  See <a href="#using-references">Using References</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Values MAY also be arrays if the vocabulary allows for multiple values of the property.

      <h2>Using References</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the <a>references</a> property is to exclude any non-authoritative
        data from the defined object.  To do this, non-authoritative data is moved so
        that implementations looking to process only authoritative data may simply ignore 
        the references property and fetch any data that would be contained there from its
        authoritative source.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a property is a reference to an object that is defined authoritatively in
        some other location, the <a>references</a> property SHOULD be used.  The property
        SHOULD contain only the unique identifier or [[!URL]] where the authoritative data
        may be found.  In the references object, the URL or unique identifier MAY
        be used as the property key and a serialization of the referenced object MAY
        be provided as the property value.  This serialization of the referenced object MAY
        be incomplete so as to provide only necessary data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parsing implementations SHOULD fetch data from the authoritative source instead of using
        the references object.

            XML formats have heavily dominated serializations of social activity feeds for blogs and news feeds for years.
            Several attempts have been created over the years to attempt to bring these to a JSON format, most recently
            [[jsonfeed-v1]], which JF2 Feed gets the majority of its requirements from.  JF2 Feed is an attempt to bring
            some of the advantages of these vocabulary aware specifications under a standard vocabulary from
            [[microformats2]].

          <p>
            Fields described below have additional requirements to be considered a valid JF2 Feed, however they may contain
            any number of additional fields from [[h-feed]], [[h-entry]], and [[h-card]].  The fields below are codified as
            they are likely the most useful for feed readers; additional data is expected to be fetchable at the entry URL,
            preferably though valid [[microformats2]] markup.

          </p>

            <li><strong>type</strong> MUST be defined with a value of "feed" on the top level entry.
              All other sub-object items MUST NOT have a type value of "feed".  All direct children
              of the top level feed object MUST have a value of "entry".

            <li><strong>name</strong> MUST be defined on the top level "feed" object.  This value MUST
              be a single string value. Any direct children of the top level item SHOULD have this
              property and if present MUST be a single string value.

            <li><strong>url</strong> SHOULD be defined on the top level "feed" object.  This value MUST

            <li><strong>uid</strong> MUST be present on any entry object which is a direct child of the
              top level feed object.  This property MUST be a single string value and MUST uniquely
              identify this entry object.  This MAY be a duplicate of the entry's url property.

          <h4>JSON Feed to JF2 conversion</h4>

          <p class="note">
            As it is not sane to do this for every feed serialization currently available,
            this section is likely to only be temporary in the spec and may be moved to a
            more permanant home elsewhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            JF2 Feed was based heavily on [[jsonfeed-v1]] and as such it is quite trivial to process a
            JSON Feed as a JF2 Feed with only minor changes.  This section discusses the conversion that
            must be made for this process, most of which is simply conversion of properties to their
            [[microformats2]] equivalent.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Conversion of the top level structure</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drop or ignore the "version" property</li>
            <li>Create a property "type" with the value "feed"</li>
            <li>Rename the properties "title" to "name", "home_page_url" to "url", "icon" to "photo", and "description" to "summary"</li>
            <li>Modify the "author" property as described below</li>
            <li>Rename the "items" property to "children" and modify as described below</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Conversion of the author property on the top level or on any lower level entry</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rename the property 'avatar' to 'photo'</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Conversion of each entry in items</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rename the 'id' property to 'uid'</li>
            <li>Convert content_html and content_text into a single object under the property "content" with properties "html" and "text", leaving out either if not present or the entire property if neither are present</li>
            <li>Rename the properties
              "title" to "name",
              "image" to "photo",
              "date_published" to "published",
              "date_modified" to "updated",
              "tags" to "category",
              "banner_image" to "featured" </li>
            <li>Drop or ignore the 'external_url' property.  If content is not set, it may be useful to set content['text'] to the value of 'external_url'</li>
            <li>Keep "summary" property the same</li>
            <li>
              For each entry in the "attachments" array,
              <ol>
                <li>Rename "mime-type" to "content-type".</li>
                <li>Keep the "url" property as is.</li>
                <li>If the "content-type" field begins with "video/", add the item to the "video" property array.</li>
                <li>If the "content-type" field begins with "photo/", add the item to the "photo" property array.</li>
              </ol>

            </li>


          </ul>
          <p>
            It may be benefitial to drop any properties other than those mentioned to avoid conflicts with any future [[microformats2]] properties.

    <section id="extensions">
      <h2>Extension</h2>
      <p>
        JF2 MAY be extended by the [[!microformats2]] extension mechanism.  The 'x-*' properties created in this
        way MAY be present in any serialization of JF2.  Parsers MUST NOT halt on any unknown properties they
        encounter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="internationalization" class="informative">
      <h2>Language And Internationalization</h2>
      <p>
        In order to allow any language to be serialized in JF2, the 'lang' value can be set on any object to annotate
        the natural language of the text.  Many often ask for control structures like directionality of text and
        multiple language serializations.  Directionality of text can be accomplished with UTF-8 control characters
        which can be added to any of the values in the document.  In addition, any content inside of 'html' properties
        can have any markup as defined by [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple serializations of the same text has not been seen to be needed in practice. 
        The suggested path for accomplishing this with JF2 is to have these hosted at different locations. 
        For example, it is common practice on websites to host an alternate language version of a site under a different
        directory structure for each language (such as /en/, /jp/, /fr/, etc).

          Webmentions are accessed from an API that that returns a set of objects in JSON format similar to JF2.
          The key difference is the inclusion of some additional data wrapping the objects
          (source, verified, verified_data, etc) and all wrapped in a "links" array.

    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        As with any serialization format, JF2 streams can potentially contain private and personally identifiable information.
        As such, producing and consuming implementations SHOULD take a default stance that all information in these documents are 
        private and take steps to ensure the privacy of their users.  This can include transmission only over secure connections,
        limiting access to streams, deletion of stored secure information, or any other steps that would apply to any private
        information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security-considerations">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        JF2 is not intended to contain executable code however, as JF2 allows arbitrary text it may be possible for publishers
        to craft text in an executable fashion.  As such, JF2 documents should not be passed through any executable mechanism
        such as JavaScript's eval() function to be parsed.  Processing of field contents should not execute any encountered code
        and it is recommended that any HTML formatted content be filtered to remove any executable code such as script and style tags.
      </p>

      <p>
        JF2 documents may require privacy and integrity services depending on the document content and implementation
        concerns.  If such services are required, they must be provided externally such as by the use of SSL/TLS connections
        to prevent forgery or exposure of data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any externally linked documents must be processed by their own format's security model. JF2 documents do not make any claims
        about the security of any externally referenced documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        JF2 Streams are JSON Documents and are subject to the same security considerations described in [[!RFC7159]].
